### Overview

This analysis of the ride sharing data broke down the different regions of operation and showed which areas had the most drivers, which areas had the most rides, which areas had the highest fares, and which areas were most profitable for the drivers.

### Results

The results here were as expected: the urban areas led the number of rides and the rural areas had the least.  The urban areas had thirty times the number of drivers as the rural areas. The fares were most expensive in the rural area, but the volume of rides in the urban areas far surpassed both suburban and rural combined. The urban drivers made the least, and had the lowest fares, while the rural drivers made the most and had the highest fares. The average number of rides per driver in urban areas is .67 while rural is are 1.6. The suburban drivers are averaging 1.27 rides per driver.

### Summary

There is a huge disparity between rural and urban drivers here. A solution to this would be moving urban drivers to other locations.
If this ride sharing company becomes an employer rather than a contractor, many people are going to be laid off. Shuffling drivers around different areas could help alleviate this. A supplemental wage for urban drivers could also help alleviate this.
Another option would be to dismantle the urban rides and the service only be for suburban and rural areas, making people rely on public transport or their own mobility.
A minimum charge would be another option for urban rides, since they are the lowest netting per driver.  Having a set minimum could boost the urban ride fares thus helping the drivers.
